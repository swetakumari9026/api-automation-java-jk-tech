# API Automation Framework

## Overview

This project implements a comprehensive API automation framework designed to validate all critical functionalities of a RESTful API. The framework is built with **Java**, **RestAssured**, **TestNG**, and **Cucumber**, and features advanced reporting using **Extent Reports**. It supports scalable, maintainable, and reusable test automation for CRUD operations with detailed test reports and CI/CD integration.

## Features

* Complete CRUD API test coverage (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
* Positive and negative test scenarios
* Request chaining to use output from one API call as input to another
* Environment-specific configuration via `config.properties`
* Integration with Cucumber for behavior-driven development (BDD) style tests
* TestNG as the test execution engine for flexible test management
* Advanced, detailed HTML reports powered by Extent Reports
* Listener-based logging for real-time test feedback
* CI/CD pipeline setup via Jenkins (or GitHub Actions, easily extendable)

## Setup & Configuration

1. **Prerequisites:**

   * Java 11+ installed and configured
   * Maven installed (`mvn` command available)
   * IDE of choice (IntelliJ, Eclipse, VSCode)
   * Jenkins (optional) for CI/CD

2. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://your-repo-url.git
   cd your-project
   ```

3. **Configure API Endpoint:**
   Update the `config.properties` file:

   ```properties
   base.url=https://api.yourdomain.com
   environment=dev
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

---

## How to Run Tests

* **Run all tests via Maven:**

  ```bash
  mvn test
  ```

* **Run tests using TestNG suite:**

  ```bash
  mvn test -DsuiteXmlFile=testng.xml
  ```

* **Run tests via IDE:**
  Execute `TestRunner.java` as a TestNG test or run feature files via Cucumber plugin.

---

## Reporting

* **Extent Reports:**
  After test execution, detailed HTML reports will be generated in the `extent-reports` folder.
  Open `extent-reports/report.html` in your browser to view a rich, interactive report showing:

  * Passed/Failed/Skipped tests
  * Detailed logs and screenshots (if any)
  * Test execution time and environment info

* **Cucumber Reports:**
  Cucumber also produces an HTML report in `target/cucumber-html-report.html` for BDD test overview.

---

## Testing Strategy

* **Modular Design:**
  Reusable POJOs and step definitions keep the framework clean and maintainable.

* **Comprehensive Test Coverage:**
  Covers all CRUD operations with both positive and negative test cases.

* **Request Chaining:**
  Uses data returned by one API to feed into subsequent API requests ensuring realistic flows.

* **Assertions:**
  Robust validation on HTTP status codes, response payloads, headers, and error messages.

* **Configuration Management:**
  Uses a properties file to easily switch between environments (dev, QA, prod).

## Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge                                   | Solution                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Handling dynamic data between API calls     | Implemented request chaining via shared variables (e.g., `userId`) in tests |
| Reporting detailed logs with screenshots    | Integrated Extent Reports with TestNG listener for rich HTML reports        |
| Managing parallel execution and flaky tests | Configured TestNG with proper dependencies and isolation in tests           |
| CI/CD integration with Jenkins pipelines    | Created Jenkinsfile with stages for build, test, and report publication     |

---

## CI/CD Integration

* The `Jenkinsfile` includes:

  * Code checkout from Git
  * Maven build and test execution
  * JUnit report publishing
  * Extent report publishing as HTML artifact

* You can configure **GitHub Actions** or other CI tools similarly to run tests on each push or PR.

---

## Future Improvements

* Add data-driven testing with external CSV or JSON files
* Integrate API contract testing with tools like Pact
* Add automated performance testing hooks
* Implement parallel test execution and distributed testing
* Extend reporting with Slack/email notifications
